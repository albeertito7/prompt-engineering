    "  - If you precise to extract the sentiment, positive or negative, from a piece of text, in a traditional machine workflow,<br/>\n",
    "  you have to collect a label dataset, train de model, figure out how to deploy the model somewhere in the cloud and make inferences.\n",
    "  - That could work pretty well, but it was just a lot of work to go through that process.\n",
    "  - Also for every task, such sentiment versus extracting names versus something else, you have to train and deploy a separate model.\n",
    "  - One of the really nice things about LLMs is that for many tasks like these, you can just write a prompt.\n",
    "  - This feature gives tremendous speed in terms of application development.\n",
    "  - Using one model and one API, to do many different tasks rather than needing to figure out how to train and deploy a lot of different models."
