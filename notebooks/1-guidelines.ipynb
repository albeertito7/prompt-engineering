    "# Guidelines Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "There lots of web interfaces such as the ChatGPT web interface, which many people is using to do specific and often one-off tasks.<br/>\n",
    "But, the clear power of large language models (LLMs) as a developer tool, is using API calls to LLMs to quickly build software applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two types of LLMs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Base LLM \n",
    "  - predicts next words, based on text training data\n",
    "  - trained with a huge amount of data from the internet and other sources, to figure out what's the next most likely word to follow an input text.\n",
    "  - the prediction is based on the patterns inherited from those amounts of trained data\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "in_message = \"Once upon a time, there was a unicorn\"\n",
    "prediction = \"that lived in a magical forest.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But, considering the next example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "input_msg = \"What is the capital of England?\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "then, based on what articles on the internet might have been used to train the LLM,<br/>\n",
    "it's quite possible that the completion might be something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"What is England's largest city?\"\n",
    "\"What is England's population?\"\n",
    "\"What is the currency of England?\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "because, maybe, articles on the internet could quite plausibly be a lists of quiz questions about the country of England.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instruction Tuned LLM\n",
    "  - from a Base LLM\n",
    "  - has been trained to follow instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if you were to ask what is the capital of England, it's much more likely to get a completion such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"The capital of England is London\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Instruction Tuned LLM are trained?\n",
    "\n",
    "  - start with a Base LLM trained with huge amount of data\n",
    "  - further, trained with inputs and outputs that are instructions, and good attemps to follow those instructions\n",
    "  - often, further refine using RLHF: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback"

    "## Prompting Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use an instruction-tuned LLM, think of giving instructions to another person.<br/>\n",
    "If the LLM doesn't work as expected, sometimes is because the instructions were not clear enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Principles of Prompting:\n",
    "  1. Write clear and specific instructions.\n",
    "  2. Give the model time to think.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't confuse to write a clear prompt into writing a short prompt.<br/>\n",
    "Because in many cases actually longer prompts provide more clarity and context, which can actually lead to more detailed outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Principle 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tactic 1:** Use delimiters to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input.\n",
    "  - Triple quotes: \"\"\"\n",
    "  - Triple backticks: ```\n",
    "  - Triple dashes: ---\n",
    "  - Angle brackets: < >,\n",
    "  - XML tags: `<tag></tag>`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tactic 2:** Ask for structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tactic 3:** Ask the model to check wether conditions are satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tactic 4:** Few-shot prompting.\n",
    "  - give successful examples of completing tasks\n",
    "  - then ask model to perform the task\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Principle 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tactic 1:** Specify the steps required to complete a task.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tactic 2:** Instruct the model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion\n"
